Generator
===

The generator generates various files in the engine according to custom
definitions in a directory of the game that's using the engine.

I've tried to comment the code in here to make up for the inherently funky 
trickery and witchcraft of some of the things we're forced to do here in 
order to integrate the code from the game directory into the engine.
