[BUILD]

output files into /tmp/sameriver

generate basic _component.go files (incl. basic SafeGet())

write func to detect if data type is primitive value or struct/map/slice

require copy function to be defined if not primtive value

copy function to be integrated into SafeGet()

if component type is struct, find struct def in file named via camel to underscore conversion .go

copy struct-defining file into output dir, with all instances of "engine." elided, import of engine removed, and package changed to engine

verify output is all good and won't clobber anything - then set to output to engine dir
