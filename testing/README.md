Testing
===

This directory contains various scripts used to test aspects of the game/engine.

Some of them have errors or are in a state of disrepair or will only work, if
importing packages from the engine, using the engine as it was when they were
written. 

This is more like a sketchpad area than a part of the codebase. I just want it
committed to the repo so it's always in one place. This is a fun and interesting
part of writing a game/engine which I'll preserve rather than delete so the repo
appears more "pure". Nonsense.
