This script shows a bunch of crow entities which compete to eat beetles. They
use AtomicEntityModify, and never eat the same beetle as a result.

There is still an improvment to make in that they duplicate a ton of work by 
not using an entity class pattern to watch a single list of beetles, either
stored by the entity class or even on the entity manager itself
