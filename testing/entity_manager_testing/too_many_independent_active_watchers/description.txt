this test (see the attached log.txt) shows that EntityManager.Update() will fail
when where are too many active watchers. This is why a set of common lists and
the grouping of spawned entities under an entity class is important for
performance. (also an interesting idea, define queries as strings and determine
query equality at time of requestin a list. return the existing list if the
query already exists)
