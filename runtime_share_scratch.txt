let's say we have 4 runners

we divide allowance_ms = 12 into 4

3 each

runner0 runs 3 functions:

1ms 1ms 5ms

(allowance_ms -= 6)

runner1 runs 3 functions

1ms 1ms 4ms

(allowance_ms -= 6) now 0

ran = 2
len(r.runners) = 3
so starved = 1





now what if we had

0
1ms 1ms 12ms

then 1 and 2 get starved
